# python-challenge
For this challenge we have two different data sets we were looking at. One for banks profits/losses and the other for election results. The two have been separated into two different directories PyBank/ and PyPoll/ respectively. There's a python script in each directory that when run, looks through the information in a csv file and generates an analysis report. The results are printed to an output file under the analysis/ directory and the csv file is located under the Resources/ directory.

Here is the list of files for each dataset -
1. PyBank
    - Script: pybank.py
    - CSV file: budget_data.csv
    - Analysis output file: pybank_analysis.txt
2. PyPoll
    - Script: pypoll.py
    - CSV file: election_data.csv
    - Analysis output file: pypoll_analysis.txt
